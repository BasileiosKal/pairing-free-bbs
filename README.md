[Editors Draft](https://basileioskal.github.io/pairing-free-bbs/draft-vasilis-pairing-free-bbs.html)

## Building and Display

The files are includeed in HTML for easier reading and navigation. 

You can build the html files runing `make`. This requires [xml2rfc](https://author-tools.ietf.org/) and [mmark](https://github.com/mmarkdown/mmark) already installed. If you are on Windows, you will need to install and use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) with a Linux distribution.
